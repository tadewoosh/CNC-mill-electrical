# CNC-mill-electrical
The electrical part of the CNC mill project.

This repo contains the files needed for construction of a custom machine controller based on the [GRBL 1.1](https://github.com/gnea/grbl) project. If you dont want to make your own PCB you can still use GRBL compatible Arduino boards.
